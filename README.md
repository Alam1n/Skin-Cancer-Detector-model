# Skin-Cancer-Detector-model
This repository contains the code and files for an animal image classification project using TensorFlow.

### Project Overview
In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to classify images of balck spots on the skin into bengnin or malignent cancer cells. The model was built using the EfficientNetB0 architecture, a pretrained model available in TensorFlow.

### Key Features:
* Model: EfficientNetB0, a highly efficient CNN architecture.

* Accuracy: The model achieves approximately 94% accuracy in classifying animal images across the ten classes.
* Loss:
