# Skin-Cancer-Detector-model
This repository contains the code and files for an animal image classification project using TensorFlow.

### Project Overview
In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to classify images of balck spots on the skin into bengnin or malignent cancer cells. The model was built using the EfficientNetB0 architecture, a pretrained model available in TensorFlow.

### Key Features
* Model: EfficientNetB0

EfficientNetB0 is a highly efficient CNN architecture that scales up in width, depth, and resolution while maintaining performance. Itâ€™s known for its balance of efficiency and accuracy.
* Accuracy: Approximately 94%

The model demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant skin spots.
* Loss: Approximately 0.15

The model achieves a low loss value, indicating effective training and good performance in classification tasks.
Model Architecture
The EfficientNetB0 model is used as the backbone for this classification task. It has been pre-trained on a large dataset
